This exercise demonstrates the "printing" function, where text is printed to the screen when the program is run. This exercise also makes use of a comment, which the program ignores when it runs. Comments are for the benefit of programmers, and have no impact on the program's functionality. They are essentially just notes for the reference of a programmer.
