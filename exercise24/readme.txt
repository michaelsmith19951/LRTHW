This is the 24th exercise that does a review of some subjects that have been covered thus far. The \\ escapes are used, as well as \n for creating new lines and \t for tabbing a line. A "heredoc" is used in combination with \n and \t to create a poem that has modified spacing. Some math operations are done too with multiplication, division, and modulus. Modulus is a form of division in Ruby that gives remainders after doing the division.
